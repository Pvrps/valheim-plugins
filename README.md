# Valheim-Plugins
I got a lot of requests to open-source this project, so here it is. :)

I'm back! I would like to apologize for being MIA for so long - IRL stuff got in the way but it's all sorted out now.

Since my departure, there have been so many updates that most features of my plugins were broken. I've went ahead and fixed them (so that they ***should*** work as intended) but I was not able to verify 100% of the features.

I will be rewriting my plugins from scratch and add the features that it should have had from the beginning. See the Nexus thread of Locator for updates.
