# Valheim-Plugins
I got a lot of requests to open-source this project, so here it is. :)

Since my departure, there have been so many updates that most features of my plugins were broken. I've went ahead and fixed them (so that they ***should*** work as intended) but I was not able to verify 100% of the features.

I will not be actively maintaining these mods, but feel free to open a PR with fixes if you care enough!
